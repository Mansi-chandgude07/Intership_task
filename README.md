# Internship Data Cleaning Task

## Overview
This was my first task during my internship at Softnexis. The goal was to **handle missing values and perform basic data operations** on the dataset to prepare it for further analysis.

## Objective
- Handle missing values in the dataset
- Perform basic operations (like sorting, filtering, and simple calculations)
- Ensure dataset is clean and ready for analysis

## Tools & Skills Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
  

## Steps Performed
1. Identified missing values in the dataset
2. Replaced missing values using median or mode (as suitable)
3. Performed basic data operations like:
   - Sorting columns
   - Filtering rows
   - Calculating simple statistics (mean, median, sum)
4. Verified the cleaned dataset and saved the output
