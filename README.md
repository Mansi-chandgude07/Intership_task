# 📊 Credit Card & Loan Risk Assessment Project  
### Internship Task Submission

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is developed as part of my internship task on **Credit Card and Loan Risk Assessment**.  

The main objective is to analyze customer financial data and build a predictive model to identify whether a customer is likely to default on a credit card or loan.

This project includes:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation

---

## 🎯 Internship Task Objectives

✔ Understand the dataset structure  
✔ Perform data preprocessing and cleaning  
✔ Visualize important patterns in the data  
✔ Identify key risk factors affecting default  
✔ Build a machine learning classification model  
✔ Evaluate model performance

## 📂 Dataset Features

The dataset contains the following attributes:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Employment_Type  
- Annual_Income  
- Credit_Score  
- Loan_or_Credit_Amount  
- Credit_Limit  
- Utilization_Ratio  
- Number_of_Active_Accounts  
- Past_Default_Count  
- Application_Type  
- Region  
- Default_Status (Target Variable)  
- Approval_Status  

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Removed unnecessary columns
- Handled missing values using median and mode
- Checked and removed duplicates
- Converted categorical variables using encoding techniques
- Verified data consistency

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following visualizations were created:

- Default Status Distribution
- Annual Income Distribution (Histogram)
- Loan Amount vs Default (Boxplot)
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pairplot (Multiple Feature Relationships)
- Credit Score vs Default (Swarm Plot)

### 🔍 Key Insights

- Customers with lower credit scores have higher default probability.
- High utilization ratio increases financial risk.
- Higher loan amounts show slightly higher default tendency.
- Past default history strongly influences future default behavior.

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

Additional features created:

- Debt-to-Income Ratio
- High Utilization Flag
- Income Bands (if implemented)

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

Model Used:
- Logistic Regression

Steps:
1. Train-Test Split
2. Model Training
3. Prediction
4. Performance Evaluation

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This internship project demonstrates how data analysis and machine learning can be used to assess credit risk and support financial decision-making.  

The analysis shows that **Credit Score, Utilization Ratio, Loan Amount, and Past Default Count** are key indicators of customer default risk.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Implement advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
- Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit
- Build an interactive dashboard
